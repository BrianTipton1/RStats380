This page contains the weekly laboratory materials.

[R](<https://cran.r-project.org/>) is an open source (free) software for statistical computing and graphics. More information on R in this [page](<http://www.siue.edu/~jpailde/Intro_to_R.html>).

[RStudio](<https://www.rstudio.com/>) is a popular front-end (IDE) for R giving you a console, a scripting window, a graphics window, and an R workspace, among other options.

### Directions

* Read the weekly lessons first and try out the R codes before answering the week's exercise.

* Download the week's exercise file and open the file using RStudio. **Right click the link and "Save as..." to your desktop folder (or any folder you keep all the lab materials).** In some cases you might need to change the file extension to `.Rmd`.

* This RMarkdown `(.Rmd)` file type is used widely to share R codes and reproduce statistical results. More information is found on this [page](<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html>).

    - Open the file `Week1-Exercise.Rmd` using RStudio.
    
    - Write your R code inside the [code chunks](<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html>) after each question.
    
        ```
            # Code Chunks
            ```{r }
            
            ```
        ```
        
        
    - Write your short comments after the hashtag `#` sign. For longer comments, write it outside the work chunk.
    
    - To generate the word document output, click the button `Knit` and wait for the word document to appear.
    
    - RStudio will prompt you to install the `knitr` package.
    

* Submit your completed laboratory exercise using Blackboard's Turnitin feature. Your Turnitin upload link is found on your [Blackboard](<https://bb.siue.edu/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabAction?tab_tab_group_id=_35_1>) course shell under the Laboratory folder.
